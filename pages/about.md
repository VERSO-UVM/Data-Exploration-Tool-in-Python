#### Open-Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)

The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is an initiative that grows the impact of academic research by making research products accessible to other academics, local businesses, and community members through open source projects. ORCA creates these products through student project teams called Pods -- groups of dynamic and passionate students who learn industry open source practices by working on real products destined for public use. This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont [Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/).

ORCA's goals are to produce impactful, accessible, open source research tools by training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills. This Repository contains all the supporting documentation and policies for the ORCA program. These documents are meant to help new ORCA members learns the program, show project sponsors how we work, and provide a template that can be "forked" to other academic institutions.

#### The Vermont Livability Map

[Vermont Livability Map Page](https://verso-uvm.github.io/Vermont-Livability-Map/)

The **Vermont Livability Map** is an open-source tool developed by VERSO-UVM to visualize critical datasets that influence the quality of life across Vermont. This interactive map aims to support policymakers, planners, researchers, and community members in making informed decisions related to zoning, infrastructure, and environmental resilience.

The Vermont Livability Map tells the story of the Vermont Zoning Atlas Project and combines data from the Vermont Zoning Atlas, the Wastewater Infrastructure Map, and a flood risk map to provide an educational exploration of how zoning and infrastructure affect livability in Vermont. It leverages open data and open-source technology to create an accessible resource that supports sustainable development, emergency preparedness, and policy analysis.

#### Vermont Zoning Atlas

The [Vermont Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/vermont) is a web-based geospatial interface that visualizes zoning code distributions across all of Vermont. Zoning rules can present barriers to effective city planning, impairing our ability to achieve important policy objectives like community desegregation, climate change resiliency, transportation access, homelessness relief, and affordable housing development. The Vermont Zoning Atlas seeks to democratize researchers', policymakers', advocates', and everyday citizens' understanding of zoning regulations and enable apples-to-apples cross-jurisdiction comparisons through a methodology developed by our partner, the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/).
Without this tool, one would have to read thousands of pages of dense legal code to answer simple questions - this is why we believe our tool will democratize zoning policy and make it possible for advocates and researchers to identify barriers to things like affordable housing development, climate resiliency, and community desegregation more quickly.


#### Wastewater Infrastructure Mapping
This initiative, in collaboration with the Windham Regional Commission systematically maps wastewater infrastructure data to understand its impact on economic activity and housing development. This includes finding what data is already available, working with partners to determine the format of the data to be collect, and then working with available online resources and reaching out to towns to identify and record wastewater systems.

UVM students continuously compile and publish town-level wastewater infrastructure data on a publicly accessible repository, working in tandem with state agencies like the Vermont Center for Geographic Information, the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development.

These efforts will be in collaboration with the Town of Jericho's efforts to pilot an outreach strategy to educate and empower stakeholders with essential information on funding pathways, resources, and planning considerations. These efforts aim not only to address immediate development challenges but also to align with broader state objectives outlined in the Vermont Climate Action Plan, Comprehensive Energy Plan, and Long-Range Transportation Plan, fostering a holistic approach to sustainable growth and resilience.
